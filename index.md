## Highlights

<!-------------------------------------->

We are working to understand how genetic and phenotypic diversity, both at large scales and within species, shapes the assembly and function of host-associated microbes. We are particularily interested in these questions in the context of drugs/xenobiotics, dietary peturbations, and infectious disease.

We are committed to creating a positive lab culture to train the next generation of scientists who are as comfortable with cluster computing as they are with a pipette.
