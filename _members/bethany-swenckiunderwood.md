Bethany is a Research Technologist at the Bisanz lab, leveraging her diverse technical expertise to advance human microbiome research projects. She also coordinates the OHMC Co-laboratory, optimizing methods and providing hands-on training to researchers.

Bethany earned her BSc in Molecular and Cell Biology from Penn State University, where she studied the regulation of gene expression by growth factors in livestock. She then joined Dana Farber Cancer Institute, contributing to research on transcription factors related to hematopoiesis and epithelial cell differentiation.

From there, she was recruited to Millennium Pharmaceuticals, a genomics start-up, where she cloned novel genes and assessed their potential as druggable targets, playing a key role in characterizing the company’s first monoclonal antibody. Building on this experience, she joined Johnson & Johnson’s biotherapeutics division, where she expressed and characterized a variety of therapeutic proteins. Her contributions were instrumental in the successful BLA submissions for notable biotherapeutics including Remicade, Simponi, Stelara, and Tremfya.

Beyond the lab, Bethany enjoys walking her dog, kayaking, tackling puzzles, and cheering on her favorite sports teams.
