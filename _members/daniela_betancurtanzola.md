Daniela received her double BSc degree in Microbiology and Biology, and her MSc in Computational Biology from the University of Los Andes in Bogotá, Colombia. During her MSc, she studied how high-fiber diets modulate the gut microbiome and host metabolism metabolic syndrome. She also worked as a research technician at Cornell University in the Human Development Department. There, she performed learning and memory studies in rats and carried out human gut microbiome studies. Her research interests focus on the ecology of the gut microbiome and how it affects the host’s physiology and health. She likes hiking, jogging, and reading non-fiction books in her free time.
