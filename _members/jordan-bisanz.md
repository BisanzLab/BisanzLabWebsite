Jordan Bisanz is an assistant professor of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at the Pennsylvania State University and the One Health Microbiome Center. The Bisanz lab combines computational analyses and wet lab experimentation to understand how gut microbes interact with each other and their host. The lab specializes in coupling human intervention studies with multi â€˜omics approaches and gnotobiotic models to understand how host-microbe interactions shape health generating both mechanistic insights and translational targets. When not in the lab, Jordan enjoys playing music (mediocrely but loudly), and experimenting with fermentation at home.
