Jordan received his PhD in Microbiology and Immunology from the University of Western Ontario where he was drawn to human microbiome research as an undergraduate. Working with Gregor Reid at the Canadian Centre for Human Microbiome and Probiotic Research, he studied how lactobacilli and gut microbes interact with environmental pollutants which included stints in Mwanza Tanzania, and the Pasteur Institute in Lille. For his postdoctoral training, he moved to UC San Francisco to work with Peter Turnbaugh focusing on merging computational and experimental methods to dissect the interactions between microbes, diet, drugs, and the host. Jordan has been fortunate to receive funding from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, The Canadian International Development Agency, and continuing funding from the NIH. When not in the lab, Jordan enjoys playing music (mediocrely but loudly), and experimenting with fermentation at home.
