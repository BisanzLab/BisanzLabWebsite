Min Soo received his bachelor's degree in Chemistry from Swarthmore College, right outside Philadelphia, PA. After graduating, he worked as a research technician at ExxonMobil Research and Engineering in the Corporate Strategic Research to develop novel catalysts and high-efficiency processing of natural gases. He then worked at the Metabolomics Core at the Cardiovascular institute at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine where he utilized liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry to quantitate metabolites in biological samples for the Philadelphia research community, external research investigators and industry. Since joining the Bisanz lab in 2022, Min Soo is excited to delve into the world of microbiome and investigate the interactions of microbial and host metabolic processes!
